# space-invader
A small unity project made in about 12 hours
You can play the game here [https://pingviini.itch.io/space-invader](https://pingviini.itch.io/space-invader)

## Background
I wanted to learn Unity and how to deploy a game on the web so I decided to join a game jam.

All assets made by me and some friends.

Warning: Old unity version if you want to try and build.
